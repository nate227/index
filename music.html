<h3>Besides rap artists, I enjoy rock artists as well, mainly all the 70's and 80's bands. Some of them include Def Leppard, Rush, Metallica, Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, and Tom Petty.</h3>

<h3>I also play a couple of instruments as well. I have been playing guitar since I was 6 years old, and for a brief time I played both the drums and piano.</h3>
